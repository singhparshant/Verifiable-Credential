## About The Project

Traditional paper-based certificates are susceptible to loss, damage, and forgery, and verifying their authenticity often involves time-consuming, manual processes. Embracing NEAR BOS, we're creating a digital and tamper-proof solution for digital certificates that eliminates risks of loss, damage, or forgery and automates verification. Institutions save money and time by issuing verifiable credentials efficiently. Additionally, fraud gets prevented and friction gets reduced by a significant margin.

In the educational ecosystem degrees, certificates, and student records could be held by individuals and shared directly with educational institutions or employers. This significantly simplifies the process of verifying educational credentials.

In the healthcare sector patient data could be in full control of the patients themselves. They could selectively share data with various healthcare providers, insurance companies, or research organizations, which could drastically streamline the patient experience.

Our SSI solution can facilitate the provision of government services like social security, voting, and licensing in a secure and efficient manner.
